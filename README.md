# scattering

This repository contains code for synthesis and super-resolution methods that use the scattering transform. These methods are based on the following papers:

- [Multiscale Sparse Microcanonical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02013) by Joan Bruna and Stéphane Mallat
- [Inverse Problems with Invariant Multiscale Statistics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05502.pdf) by Ivan Dokmanić, Joan Bruna, Stéphane Mallat, and Maarten de Hoop

I developed this code as part of my Bachelor Thesis at NYU while I was a visiting student under the supervision of Joan Bruna.

This repository also includes a vectorized implementation of the scattering transform based on [Kymatio](https://www.kymat.io/), which I wrote for learning purposes.
